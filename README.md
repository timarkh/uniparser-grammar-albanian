uniparser-grammar-albanian
==========================

This is a formalized description of standard Albanian morphology, which also includes a number of dialectal and historical elements. The description is carried out in the UniParser format and involves a description of the inflection (paradigms.txt) and a grammatical dictionary (sqi_lexemes_XXX.txt files). The dictionary contains descriptions of individual lexemes, each of which is accompanied by information about its stem, its part-of-speech tag and some other grammatical/borrowing information, its inflectional type (paradigm), and English translation.
